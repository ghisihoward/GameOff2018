> The theme for this year's Game Off is HYBRID! 
> 
> You’re welcome to interpret it however you wish, but if you need some ideas to kickstart your creativity, think about how your game could…
> 
> - Feature an imaginary (and hilarious) mashup of animals plants, or other objects with associated strengths and weaknesses. Giraffeopotamuses anyone?
> - Crossover different game genres, such as a turn-based platformer, real-time roguelike, or tower defense rythm game?
> - Combine multiple visual styles. Perhaps pixel art characters exploring photo-realistic worlds?
> - Include a composition of music styles and sound effects like bagpipes and breakbeats?
> - Mix genres like Comedy Horror and Weird West?
> - Be powered by alternative/multiple controls - button mashing meets mousing or mobile device interaction?
